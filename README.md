## Usage

### API Endpoint

This project includes a simple Express server that exposes the pagination function via an endpoint.

1. Start the application:

   To run the application locally, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Make a POST request to the `/functions/paginate` endpoint:

   Send a POST request to the `https://js-pagination-function.onrender.com/functions/paginate` URL with a JSON body containing the `items`, `page` and `limit`.

   Example JSON body:

   ```bash
   {
   "input": {
    "items": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 5
    }
   }
   ```

3. Example Request using curl:

   If you want to test it using curl, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
    curl -X POST https://js-pagination-function.onrender.com/functions/paginate \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"input": {"items": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], "page": 1, "limit": 5}}'
   ```

4. Example Response:

   The server will return a JSON response with metadata and paginated items. For example:

   ```bash
   {
   "totalItems": 12,
   "totalPages": 3,
   "currentPage": 1,
   "limit": 5,
   "paginatedItems": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   }
   ```

### Function Logic

The core logic of the pagination function is as follows:

- Input Validation: The function checks the types of `items`, `page` and `limit` to ensure they are valid before proceeding.
- Pagination Logic: The function calculates the total number of pages and returns the items for the requested page.
- Error Handling: If any input is invalid or required fields are missing, the function returns an error message.

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest for unit testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the Jest test suite and output the results in the terminal.

## Code Quality

The project uses Husky to enforce pre-commit hooks, ensuring that tests are run before each commit.

### Install Husky hooks

To set up the Husky hooks, run:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

This will install the pre-commit hooks, which will automatically run npm test to ensure that your tests pass before committing any changes.
